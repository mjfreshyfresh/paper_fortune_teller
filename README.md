# Paper Fortune Teller
A very simple Ruby application to show young kids some code and how it can help with practically anything.

## Basics

Edit fortune.json to your liking.
Run ```ruby teller_tester.rb``` to run the tests and create a pdf you can print and cut out

The app enforces 2 rules:
1. You the outside "choices" on the Fortune teller should have a balanced number of even/odd word lengths so that you have equal chance of landing on the "fortunes" inside.
2. The "fortunes" have to fit in a small space so the should be short
